# Command: `bot register`

## About the registration process
The registration process is a 1-step or a 2-step functionality. Indeed, some
players prefer not to have their decklist published on public channels before
the actual start of the event. To do this, the bot is programmed to accept a
call with or without parameters.

### 1-step method
This method is more straightforward and the one that is recommended due to the
lack of interaction between the bot and the player. This command also has many
options to customize one's possibilities. It is the recommended method.

#### bot register
It is still the core command to register oneself but the options will make ones
registration a unique experience :
- `-help` will display all the options
- **M** `-decklist url_to_decklist`
- **M** `-hash generated_hash`
- *f* `-nickname Chosen-Nickname`
- *f* `-cz [commander|partner1/parter2]` to register the Command Zone
- *f* `-archetype archetype_name` to label an archetype

### 2-step method
```
bot register
```
It is the signal that somebody wants to join the tournament. The bot will
then send a DM to the player for them to send both decklist and the hash
generated by the software used. The bot will help the player through the whole
process so as not to let  them figure what to do.
```
bot decklist url_to_decklist
bot hash generated_hash
```
